In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Mohamad is having trouble completing the homework every night. I would advise him to reach out more if he has any questions and ask his/her peers for help. His grade is 85. He participated in class sometimes but I would like to hear him share his ideas more often. Participation is an important part of the class because it allows me to see how engaged the student is with the class and if they are understanding the material. He earned a grade of 79. Mohamad was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work!  Mohamad's best test score was a 92 on the Midterm exam. His committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Mohamad demonstrated their understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 85% for their overall test grade. Though there were errors on some problems, his knowledge of the concepts as a whole met expectations.

Mohamad is always meticulous in the classroom. Mohamad displayed his ability to be productive whenever he worked on a group project. In addition, he always made sure to be professional. Overall, Mohamad was a good student earning a B. He displayed his knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. I wish you the best in college Mohamad! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
