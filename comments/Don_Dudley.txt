In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Don is not turning in homework consistently. We need to come up with a plan to allocate time because homework is a crucial part of this class. His grade is 80. He participated in class consistently and always offered good ideas to the class. It was clear that he was engaged with the class and he always made sure to keep his ideas relevant to the discussion. His participation grade for this semester is 99. Don was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work!  Don's best test score was a 95 on the Final exam. His committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Don demonstrated their understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 82.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were errors on some problems, his knowledge of the concepts as a whole met expectations.Don has shown clear improvement over the course of the year and I am proud of his hard work to grow in a difficult field.

Don is always achiever in the classroom. Don displayed his ability to be quick whenever he worked on a group project. In addition, he always made sure to be balanced. Overall, Don was a good student earning a B-. He displayed his knowledge of the basic course concepts throughout the year. I wish you the best in college Don! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
