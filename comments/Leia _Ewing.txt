In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Leia  was very diligent in completing the homework. A solid grade of 95. Her participation in class was good but I would like to hear a little bit more of her contributions and I want to make sure that she is offering more relevant ideas. Her participation grade for this semester is 81. Leia  was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work!  Leia 's best test score was a 88 on the Final exam. Her committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Leia  demonstrated their understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 84.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were errors on some problems, her knowledge of the concepts as a whole met expectations.Leia  has shown clear improvement over the course of the year and I am proud of her hard work to grow in a difficult field.

Leia  is always logical in the classroom. Leia  displayed her ability to be initiator whenever she worked on a group project. In addition, she always made sure to be original. Overall, Leia  was a good student earning a B. She displayed her knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. I wish you the best in college Leia ! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
