In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Rhiannon recieved a 100 which was one of the top three homework grades in the class this semester. His organization and time-management skills are above and beyond. He participated in class consistently and always offered good ideas to the class. It was clear that he was engaged with the class and he always made sure to keep his ideas relevant to the discussion. His participation grade for this semester is 91. Rhiannon was more comfortable in smaller groups. I would encourage him to try to participate more in full class discussions.  Rhiannon's best test score was a 89 on the Midterm exam. His committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Rhiannon demonstrated their understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 86.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were errors on some problems, his knowledge of the concepts as a whole met expectations.

Rhiannon is always candid in the classroom. Rhiannon displayed his ability to be industrious whenever he worked on a group project. In addition, he always made sure to be cooperative. Overall, Rhiannon was a good student earning a B. He displayed his knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. I wish you the best in college Rhiannon! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
