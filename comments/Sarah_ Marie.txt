In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Sarah was very diligent in completing the homework. A solid grade of 95. Her participation in class was good but I would like to hear a little bit more of her contributions and I want to make sure that she is offering more relevant ideas. Her participation grade for this semester is 82. Sarah was more comfortable in smaller groups. I would encourage her to try to participate more in full class discussions. Sarah did a great job of showing her understanding of the material. It w Sarah's best test score was a 98 on the Final exam. Her committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Sarah demonstrated their strong understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 91.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were often small errors here and there, her preparation was clear.Sarah has shown clear improvement over the course of the year and I am proud of her hard work to grow in a difficult field.

Sarah is always quick in the classroom. Sarah displayed her ability to be balanced whenever she worked on a group project. In addition, she always made sure to be achiever. Overall, Sarah was a terrific student earning an A- . She displayed her knowledge of the course content throughout the year. Thanks for your work in this class. Hopefully this class has prepared you for whatever courses you decide to take next year and hope to see you in one of my classes again!
