In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Wil was very diligent in completing the homework. A solid grade of 95. He participated in class consistently and always offered good ideas to the class. It was clear that he was engaged with the class and he always made sure to keep his ideas relevant to the discussion. His participation grade for this semester is 94. Wil was more comfortable in larger groups. I would encourage him to try to participate more in small groups. Wil did a great job of showing his understanding of the material. It w Wil's best test score was a 95 on the Midterm exam. His committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off.
