In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Kaitlyn was very diligent in completing the homework. A solid grade of 94. She participated in class sometimes but I would like to hear her share her ideas more often. Participation is an important part of the class because it allows me to see how engaged the student is with the class and if they are understanding the material. She earned a grade of 78. Kaitlyn was more comfortable in smaller groups. I would encourage her to try to participate more in full class discussions. Kaitlyn did a great job of showing her understanding of the material. It w Kaitlyn's best test score was a 93 on the Midterm exam. Her committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Kaitlyn demonstrated their strong understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 90.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were often small errors here and there, her preparation was clear.

Kaitlyn is always productive in the classroom. Kaitlyn displayed her ability to be professional whenever she worked on a group project. In addition, she always made sure to be meticulous. Overall, Kaitlyn was a great student earning a B+ . She displayed her knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. Thanks for your work in this class. Hopefully this class has prepared you for whatever courses you decide to take next year and hope to see you in one of my classes again!
