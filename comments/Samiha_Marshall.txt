In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Samiha is not turning in homework consistently. We need to come up with a plan to allocate time because homework is a crucial part of this class. Her grade is 80. Her participation was excellent this semester. She brought fresh new perspectives to the class and fostered respectful and interesting discussions. I am very pleased with how engaged she is. Her participation grade for this semester is 100. Samiha was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work! Samiha did a great job of showing her understanding of the material. It w Samiha's best test score was a 86 on the Final exam. Her committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Samiha demonstrated their understanding of the material on their tests, earning a 85.5% for their overall test grade. Though there were errors on some problems, her knowledge of the concepts as a whole met expectations.

Samiha is always patient in the classroom. Samiha displayed her ability to be outgoing whenever she worked on a group project. In addition, she always made sure to be particular. Overall, Samiha was a great student earning a B+ . She displayed her knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. Thanks for your work in this class. Hopefully this class has prepared you for whatever courses you decide to take next year and hope to see you in one of my classes again!
