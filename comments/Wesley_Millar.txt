In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Wesley is not turning in homework consistently. We need to come up with a plan to allocate time because homework is a crucial part of this class. His grade is 68. His participation in class was good but I would like to hear a little bit more of his contributions and I want to make sure that he is offering more relevant ideas. His participation grade for this semester is 82. Wesley was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work!  Wesley's best test score was a 78 on the Midterm exam. His committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Wesley's 71.5% overall test grade demonstrated their knowledge on many of the concepts that we covered. There were some problems that tripped him up and I encourange Wesley to email me or come to my office if he has any questions.

Wesley is always proactive in the classroom. Wesley displayed his ability to be powerful whenever he worked on a group project. In addition, he always made sure to be practical. Overall, Wesley was a good student earning a C-. He displayed his knowledge of the basic course concepts a few times during the year, but still could use a bit more practice. I wish you the best in college Wesley! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
