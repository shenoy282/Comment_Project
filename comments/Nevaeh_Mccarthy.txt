In this course, we learned the fundamental skills and content needed to analyze the behavior of objects in motion. The primary language of this field of study is mathematics, so we practiced communication with quantitative information, including statistics, rates of change, and visual representation through graphs. However, physics is more than just a math class -- it is important to realize that the way we use math in this field is shaped by its application to observation, experimentation, and the scientific method.

Nevaeh was very diligent in completing the homework. A solid grade of 94. She participated in class consistently and always offered good ideas to the class. It was clear that she was engaged with the class and she always made sure to keep her ideas relevant to the discussion. Her participation grade for this semester is 91. Nevaeh was comfortable in both small and large groups which greatly contributed to class dialogue. Keep up the great work!  Nevaeh's best test score was a 78 on the Final exam. Her committment to studying was even more evident than normal and it paid off. Nevaeh's 75% overall test grade demonstrated their knowledge on many of the concepts that we covered. There were some problems that tripped her up and I encourange Nevaeh to email me or come to my office if she has any questions.Nevaeh has shown clear improvement over the course of the year and I am proud of her hard work to grow in a difficult field.

Nevaeh is always powerful in the classroom. Nevaeh displayed her ability to be practical whenever she worked on a group project. In addition, she always made sure to be proactive. Overall, Nevaeh was a good student earning a B. She displayed her knowledge of the course content at many points over the course of the year. I wish you the best in college Nevaeh! OES will miss you deeply. Hopefully this and other classes have been able to prepare you, but for now make sure to come back and visit a few times!
